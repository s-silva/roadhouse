Summary:

What's most valued in life is the great moments we had, places we
went to and the people we spent those moments with.
We believe that technology should not be a replacement for those connections and moments,
a simulation of life, instead it should
assist people to get together, make the moments that value, with maybe
strangers or friends, maybe family. 

What we've found out about human interactions is that,
people do make connections based on places more than anything. 
That's how we got to know our siblings,
met friends at school, university, work or simply at an event.

In order to follow our vision, we built a system where people in a certain place,
at an event or simply an area can communicate as a group. And make spontaneous
events. Such that -
	
	o. A few musicians can decide to play in a community park and
annouce that to an audience who cannot see it but just around the park at the moment.

	o. Disaster relief organizations and such can communicate, share information 
and have a general conversation/plan based on the location, and establish a network
quickly without needing to collect contact information (phone numbers/email addresses) of 
each other.

	o. A new student to a university can join the conversation everybody's having
as they enter the university.

	o. People attending a large event can share the photos they took at the event
to one album.

	o. Something like a restaurent can show whoever drives near them about their
special menu  for the day, and if any special thing happens there.


The Product

The app provides real-time updates of what's happening around the user, with the
help of geolocation features of the phone. Once the user enters a room, they will
receive real-updates of the conversation and the user will be able to communicate
by various means and to share videos and photos. In addition to that, the user
will be able to keep private conversations with friends. Figure 1.1 gives a glimpse
of the app.
